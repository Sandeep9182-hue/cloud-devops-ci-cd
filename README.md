Here’s a **step-by-step README** for the **System Architecture of a Cloud-Based Automated DevOps Pipeline (CI/CD)**.  

### 📜 **README: System Architecture for Cloud-Based Automated DevOps Pipeline (CI/CD)**  

## **1️⃣ Overview**  
This project implements a **Cloud-Based Automated DevOps Pipeline** to streamline software development, testing, deployment, and monitoring using **CI/CD best practices**.  

## **2️⃣ System Architecture Diagram**  
📌 The architecture follows a **standard DevOps workflow**:  
- **Source Code Management** → **Continuous Integration** → **Continuous Deployment** → **Monitoring & Logging**  


## **3️⃣ Step-by-Step Process**



### **🟢 Step 1: Code Development & Version Control**  
- Developers write code in **Python (Flask)** and push it to **GitHub/GitLab**.  
- Version control is managed via **Git**, allowing team collaboration.

  

### **🟢 Step 2: Continuous Integration (CI)**  
- **GitHub Actions / Jenkins** is triggered on every commit/push.  
- The pipeline performs:  
  ✅ **Code Testing** → Runs `pytest` to check functionality.  
  ✅ **Code Analysis** → Uses **SonarQube** for code quality checks.  
  ✅ **Docker Image Build** → Creates an optimized image of the application.  

### **🟢 Step 3: Containerization & Image Storage**  
- **Docker** packages the application and its dependencies.  
- The image is pushed to **Docker Hub / AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** for easy access.  



### **🟢 Step 4: Continuous Deployment (CD) with Kubernetes**  
- **Kubernetes (AWS EKS / GCP GKE / Azure AKS)** manages containerized deployments.  
- **Deployment Steps:**  
  ✅ **Kubernetes pulls the latest image from Docker Hub**  
  ✅ **Pods are deployed using YAML configurations**  
  ✅ **Load Balancer (Nginx/ALB) exposes the service to users**  



### **🟢 Step 5: Monitoring & Logging**  
- **Prometheus & Grafana** → Collects and visualizes metrics.  
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** → Aggregates and analyzes logs.  
- **Alerts & Notifications** → Detects failures and sends alerts via Slack or email.  




## **4️⃣ Tools & Technologies Used**  
| Stage             | Tools & Services |
|------------------|----------------|
| Version Control  | GitHub / GitLab |
| CI/CD Pipeline   | GitHub Actions / Jenkins |
| Testing & Security | PyTest, SonarQube |
| Containerization | Docker |
| Image Storage   | Docker Hub / AWS ECR |
| Deployment      | Kubernetes (AWS EKS / GKE / AKS) |
| Monitoring     | Prometheus, Grafana |
| Logging       | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) |




## **5️⃣ How to Modify the Architecture**  
- To edit the **architecture diagram**, open `architecture/system_architecture.png` in **diagrams.net (draw.io)**.  
- Update **Kubernetes configurations** in `k8s/deployment.yaml`.  
- Modify the **CI/CD pipeline** in `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`.  




## **6️⃣ Conclusion**  
This **Cloud-Based Automated DevOps Pipeline** ensures:  
✅ **Fast & Reliable Deployments**  
✅ **Automated Testing & Security Checks**  
✅ **Efficient Monitoring & Logging**  

This system **minimizes manual errors** and **enhances DevOps efficiency**. 🚀
